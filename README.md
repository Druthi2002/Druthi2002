## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amrutha Druthi

I'm currently working as a **Data Engineer** at *JLLT*.

- Back in college, I mostly focused on theory and didnâ€™t really explore real-time projects. But once I started working, I realized how important it is to apply what you learn in real-world situations.

- During my internship, I noticed an opportunity to automate the way our team handled job failures. That led to me building **SENSE** (*Smart Event Notification & Surveillance Engine*) A solution that brought job failure tracking across multiple interfaces into one streamlined dashboard. It made things a lot more efficient for the whole data engineering team.

- Outside of work, I manage **EZhostz**, a tech community with over **1000 members**. I handle operations, organize workshops, hackathons, and seminars for colleges, and guide students through placements and tech career prep.

- Iâ€™ve also been a speaker at several seminars on **AI** and **Agentic AI**  I really enjoy breaking down complex topics and sharing what I learn with others.

- I'm also passionate about **contemporary dance** and enjoy going on **treks** to reconnect with nature whenever I get the chance.

Looking forward to learning & growing!
